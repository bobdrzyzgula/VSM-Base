# Configuring the model

*This chapter is an outline, still to be written. It will cover:*

- Opening the model and using OpenSCAD's Customizer.
- The settings that decide the fit (machine bed, reliefs, hinges) and the ones that are a matter of taste (compartment, extensions, rounding).
- The `part` setting and the views it gives: assembly, all, test parts, individual parts.
- Reading the console: what each line means, and every WARNING with what to do about it.
- Choosing a side compartment, extensions, trenches and lid hinges.

> **Note: an outlet base used for storage first.** Set
> `compartment_option = "outlet"` and `passthrough_knockouts = true`: the
> base gets the outlet's curbs and screw hole, but the cord pass-through is
> closed at both ends by thin walls, so the compartment works for storage.
> Cover the outside screw hole with the printed cap. For a storage lid,
> switch `compartment_option` to `storage` just to print the lid; it is the
> same size. When you fit the outlet, tap the two walls out with a punch and
> a small hammer, and print the outlet lid. To close the pass-through again
> later, print `passthrough_cover`.
